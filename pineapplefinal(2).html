        <p>Before we dive into this topic,

    <div class="history2">
        <p>Pineapple pizza was invented by <span class="hover-word">Sam Panopoulos</span> 
        in 1962. Though pineapple pizza is often associated with 
    Hawaii, it was actually invented in a small resturaunt in
     Ontario, Canada. </p>

    <div class="history3">
        <p>Since then, pineapple pizza took the world by storm,
        inspiring a new generation of pizza toppings. Although
    this creation was very popular, it also sparked a lot of drama 
from a group of particularly angry individuals (you know who you are)... </p>
