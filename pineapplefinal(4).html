                <p>I love pineapple on pizza. I truly think it's 
                one of the best toppings available.</p>
            </div>
            
        
            
            <div class="mytake2">
                <p>What's not there to like? It's savory yet 
                sweet, it compliments other toppings very well,and I personaly love the texture.
            </p>
            </div>

        <div class="mytake3">
            <p>And even pizza isn't known for not being the healthiest food,
            pineapple itself has a lot of health benefits 
            that just can't be ignored.</p>
